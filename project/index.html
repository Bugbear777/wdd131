                <h2>About Sedona</h2>
                <b>Sedona, Arizona: A Desert Jewel Among Red Rocks</b><br>
                Sedona is a small city in northern Arizona renowned for its breathtaking red rock formations, vibrant arts community, and spiritual atmosphere. 
                Nestled at the mouth of Oak Creek Canyon, it’s surrounded by rugged canyons, towering sandstone cliffs, and forests of pine and juniper, 
                offering a dramatic backdrop that changes hue with the shifting light of day—glowing brilliant crimson at sunrise and sunset.<br> 
                
                With a population of just over 10,000, Sedona feels both peaceful and alive. The town blends small-town charm with the sophistication of a 
                world-class destination. Its historic Uptown district features boutique shops, art galleries, cafés, and southwestern-style architecture, 
                while the Tlaquepaque Arts & Shopping Village evokes old Mexican charm with cobblestone walkways and artisan studios.<br> 
                
                Sedona is also considered a spiritual hub, attracting seekers from around the world to its famous energy vortex sites, crystal shops, 
                and wellness retreats. Visitors come for meditation, yoga, and healing experiences, drawn by the belief that the landscape itself holds transformative power.<br>
                
                Adventure lovers will find no shortage of thrills—hiking, mountain biking, and Jeep tours explore trails like Cathedral Rock, 
                Devil’s Bridge, and Bell Rock. And just a short drive away lies the Coconino National Forest, with its lush greenery and high-desert beauty.<br>
                
                Whether you're coming for inspiration, relaxation, or exploration, Sedona offers a blend of natural wonder, cultural richness, 
                and spiritual serenity that’s unlike anywhere else in the American Southwest.
